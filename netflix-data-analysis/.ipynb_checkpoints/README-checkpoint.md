Absolutely! Below is a full `README.md` draft for your **Netflix Dataset Analysis** project, covering everything you've done in **Step 1: Data Identification & Exploration**.

You can copy-paste this into your `README.md` file in your GitHub repo/project folder.

# Netflix Dataset Analysis

This project explores and analyzes the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset**. The aim is to understand the dataset's structure, clean and prepare the data, visualize trends, and extract key insights as a way of recalling the basics of data handling.

---

## Step 1: Data Identification & Initial Exploration

# 1. Dataset Loading

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("netflix_titles.csv")
```

I loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for manipulation and analysis.

---

# 2. Data Preview and Structure

```python
df.head()
df.shape
df.columns
df.info()
```


# 3. Column Types Identification

```python
cat_cols = df.select_dtypes(include='object').columns.tolist()
date_cols = df.select_dtypes(include='datetime').columns.tolist()
num_cols = df.select_dtypes(include='number').columns.tolist()
```

I categorized columns into:

* **Categorical** (`object`): e.g., title, type, genre
* **Date/Time**: e.g., date\_added
* **Numeric**: e.g., duration in minutes (if present)

---

# 4. Date Parsing and Feature Extraction

```python
df['date_added'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_added'])
df['year_added'] = df['date_added'].dt.year
df['month_added'] = df['date_added'].dt.month
```

I converted `date_added` to a datetime format and extracted `year` and `month` to help in time-based analysis.

---

# 5. Basic Visualization


I used a bar chart that shows the distribution between **Movies** and **TV Shows**.

I used a heatmap to visualize correlation between numeric variables (e.g., `year_added`, etc.).

# Step 2: Data Cleaning

Step 2 involves basic initial activities like data cleaning. The column that has the most null values is that of a director but i think thta for now I will choose the keep the columns cast and director since those are integral parts of any piece of media. I will have to find another way to work around the data in somw way to make it more efficient.
